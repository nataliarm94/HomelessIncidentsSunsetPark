	<p>Sunset Park, Brooklyn- Two years after Mayor Bill de Blasio introduced a city-wide plan that would end the use of hotels as temporary homeless shelters, Sunset Park residents still feel overwhelmed by homeless hotels and the incidents that occur around them.</p>


	<p>There have been 10 times as many incidents involving homeless people in Sunset Park since 2010. Over 140 in 2018 alone.</p>

	<p>In 2016, the neighborhood saw its highest point of homeless related incidents.</p>

	<p>“We would see DHS agents walking in and out of the hotel. We made multiple attempts to get answers, then suddenly the hotel was a shelter,” said Jeremy Laufer, district manager of Community Board 7 in Brooklyn.</p>

	<p>Last year alone, two hotels received funding to become temporary housing for homeless people in the Brooklyn district.</p>

<p>Currently, the district is home to three homeless shelters and nine hotels rented by the city.</p>

<p>“Sunset Park doesn’t produce homeless people, they bus them in during the middle of the night from different parts of the city,” said María Roca, a retired economist and now local activist.</p>

<p>However, according to a 2017 report by the New York City Comptroller, the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) was spending over $530,000 every day on commercial hotel booking.</p>

<p>According to Laufer, in the past two instances, the DHS has failed to notify the Community Board and residents before turning hotels into temporary shelters.</p>

<p>During the last community board meeting in Sunset Park regarding homelessness, residents made sure to point out that empathy towards homeless people was necessary. Nevertheless, they raised concerns over safety.</p>

<p>After the spike, de Blasio introduced Home-Stat, a program aimed to end the use of “cluster site” buildings and hotels as shelters for homeless people and the very program Sunset Park residents expected to reduce the amount of homeless hotels in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>“We’re paying for a service that they’re not even receiving. The DHS just drops them here and don’t give them the help they really need,” said Roca.</p>

<p>Although the current number of homeless people residing in Sunset Park is not clear, representatives of City Councilman Carlos Menchaca stated that in District 38—which includes Sunset Park, Red Hook, Greenwood Heights, and portions of Borough Park, Dyker Heights and Windsor Terrace—houses over 700 people.</p>
